# Debloatio (alpha)
A PowerShell script to remove Microsoft bloat apps, and more coming soon.

Make sure to make a System Restore point before using this script.

# Requirements
* Windows 11 or Windows 10
* *Recommended* Clean installation. Not required, but this might not work with other apps. This also won't work with other debloaters for obvious reasons.

## With AtlasOS
It is in an **unknown state** due to optimization with PowerShell, which may affect certain commands. It is also not recommended to use Debloatio on top of other debloaters as well.
